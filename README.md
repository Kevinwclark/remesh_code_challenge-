# Remesh Clone

A simplified version of Remesh. The basics of Remesh are such that there are conversations. In each conversation, users send messages. Another group of users respond to those messages by submitting thoughts.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software.
* Go to [Python](https://www.python.org/) for instructions to install - test if it installed with the command below. You should see a version like 3.9.0. If not, please recheck the Python instructions. 
```
python --version 
```
* Go to [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/#id2) for instructions to install. Test with command below. You should see something similar to 'pipenv, version 2020.11.15'

"Pipenv is a dependency manager for Python projects. If you’re familiar with Node.js’s npm or Ruby’s bundler, it is similar in spirit to those tools. While pip can install Python packages, Pipenv is recommended as it’s a higher-level tool that simplifies dependency management for common use cases. -quoted from [here](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/#id2)"

```
pipenv --version 
```
With everything installed we can move forward. 

## Getting Started

* Go to the GitHub [Remesh Repo](https://github.com/Kevinwclark/remesh_code_challenge-) and clone the repo. Open a terminal or command line and cd to the directory you would like to place this project. Enter the below command. 

```
git clone <name of repository>
```
Now we should have the software local on our machine. Type the command below to show the contents of the directory. You should see 'remesh_code_challenge-'
```
ls
```
Now that we have it lets move into the directory with:
```
cd remesh_code_challenge-
```

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Installing
